Thence to S. Saturninus the contents are lost, and there is no
Festum Visitationis B. M. V. On 6 August is the service for
the T ransfiguration, to which M. Fothergill has appended a
note in MS„ ‘ not in the MS. Brev. Ebor.,' which same note is
added to the service sor the next day, ‘In festo nominis Jesu.’
It is to be recognised as a York book from having the feast
of S. William (8 June), that of S. Wilfrid (12 Oct), and of the
translation of S. John of Beverley (2 5 October). In size it is
,εὖ inches by 33 wide : it is bound like E, with the York
Library stamp on it.

G. DR. Go'rT’s Copv OF 1533. ⁸

This, with its sellow volume N, in the British Museum,
gives us the latest known arrangement and text of the York
Breviary. They are therefore of great value ε and being very
correctly printed, are most useful for collation. G (Pars Hye-
malis) was bought by Dr. Gott at the Saville sale in 1860.
In the Catalogue of the sale the following notice was added:
‘ A diminutive and excessively rare volume, in black and
‘ red letter, of an impression of which no other copy is known to
‘ exist. With the exception of a portion of the last leaf being
‘ torn away to the extent of the last six lines, it is in beauti-
‘ ful condition, and in old binding. It possesseS, on the title,
‘ the autograph of “Hem-icus Comes Arundell,'” &c. In spite
of the assertion here made, we may safely affirm that there is
another copy of this impression, viz. N, which is the Pars Esti-
valiS, answering to this ; for, although there is no date in N to
prove it is of the year 1533, it is clear by comparing in each the
parts which are common to both, that they both belong
to the same edition. The title-page in G is as follows:
01 Breviarium insignis ac metropolitane ecclesie E baracensis·
una curn Pica (quod vulgo dicitur) diligentissime emendatum :
et in Parisiorum Academia expensis Francisci Regnault ejus-
dem universitatis bibliopole jurati ε et honesti viri Joannis
Gascheti in predicta Eboracensi civitate commorantis impres-
sum. 01 Pars Hyemalis. Venit Parisiis F rancisco Regnault
sub insigni Elephantis e regione Maturinorum‚ 1533. The
Colophon (which is on h h 4, the last page of the Sanctorale)
is as follows: (Ι Finit pars Hyemalis tam de tempore quam
de sanctis breviarii ad usum insignis ecclesie E baracensis.
