THE Breviary, or Portiforium, according to the use of York
is herewith presented to the Surtees Society: thus completing,
with the exception of the Horae, the reprints of the several
printed Service Books which belonged to the great Nox-thern
Diocese.

Concerning the varying forms of the Breviary little defi-
nite information can be gathered from bookS. What Doctor
Neale said thirty years ago still remains true: ‘ T he History
⁴ os the Breviary, not only from the time that it came as a
‘ book, so-called, into use, about 1050, but from the very
‘ commencement of the gradual process of its formation, is
‘ a great desideratum, perhaps the great desideratum, in
‘ ritualistic works.’ ¹ And of English Breviaries in particular,
their forms and peculiarities, there is much lack of accurate
knowledge. Mr. Maskell, in his invaluable work, Monumenta
Ritualia,² Dr. Neale, in his Liturgiological EssayS, and David
Laing, in his Preface to the Breviarium Aberdonense,³ have
written most to the purpose. And something towards a
comparison of the Uses in England was attempted in the
learned but unhappily uncompleted reprint of the Sarum
Portiforium by Mr. Seager.⁴ Now that we are able to present
