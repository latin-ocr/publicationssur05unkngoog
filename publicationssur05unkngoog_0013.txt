the public with an accurate reprint of the most ancient known
text of our Breviary, we trust that a new stimulus will be
given to investigation. For it has been felt all along that a
chief hindrance to such investigation was the want of the
original texts, The books themselves, as Mr. Maskell ob-
serveS, ‘are amongst the rar-est which still exist, and except
‘in a few instances are to be found (whether printed or
‘ manuscript) only in the great public librar-ies! ¹ For pur-
poses of handy use the texts must be in print: and towards
this end our Society has done a great literary service by their
contributionS. And when the reprint of the Sarum Breviary,
now in course of publication at Cambridge, is completed with
Mi. Bradshaw's promised preface, the Liturgical Scholar will,
we trust, find himself in a position to compare critically the
two Uses of Sarum and of York, and to contrast them with
the pre-Tridentine Breviary of Rome.

The publication of Service Books for England ceased, of
course, in 1558.² The first complete reprint of any of thern in
our days was nearly thirty years ago, when to the learning of
the Reverend W. J. Blew was entrusted the republication
of the Aberdeen Breviary. This work reflects the highest
honour on all connected with it. And though we think that
the practice of our own Society in writing out in full all con-
tractions is right, yet there is a style and character in the
Aberdeen reprint, which we should have been glad to have
been allowed to imitate.

The copy which has supplied the text for our reprint is
unique. It was printed in Venice in 1493, is a ‘totum,’ in
small octav0, and printed with contractioris throughout. It is
in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Nothing is known from
contemporary record concerning the different editions of the
York Portiforium: but it is possible that this Oxford copy is
of the earliest edition of all. A very early edition of the Paris
Breviary was printed by the same printer in Venice in 1487,
and in 1494 an edition of the Sarum Missal, long considered
to be the Editio Princeps. The Oxford book has been copied
with all its errors of punctuation and spelling, with no attempt
