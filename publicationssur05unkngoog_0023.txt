Museum Catalogue the conjectural date of 1520 is assigned
to it, and in Dr. Henderson's list os York Service Books, that
of 15 303 but, as stated above, it must be given to the year
1533. It has, like G, double columnS, with 36 lines in each
column, and in size is 4 inches by 3.

S. MR. SHERBRooKE's Corv.

This is a copy os the whole Breviary, in two volumes, but
made up os more than one edition, and with a Sarum Kalen·
dar. There is no title, and no imprint in either volume.
The date 1524, which is put on the outside by the binder‚ is
got from the table sor finding the golden number in the
Kalendar, where it is the first year os the series os nineteen.
This, however, gives no authority whatever: for this Kalendar
is⁸ not of York use, and is printed in a type unlike all York
books known. A Kalendar‚ one exactly similar to it, is found
in a Sarum Breviary os 1524, now at Oscott, printed at Paris
for Fr. Byrckman.¹ Certainly the main portions of these two
volumes (in fact, all of the Pars HyemaliS, and the Psalter
and Sanctorale os the P. Estivalis) are of an edition later
than this date. Most probably this book came out about
1555, in the reign os Philip and Mary.

Pars HyemaliS. (1) Temporale. AA to RR all in eightS.
[Note—FF is wrongly bound up after GG, and LL before HH.]

AA begins the Advent Rubric, with no title-page. (3)
Psalterium. a to k, all in eightS, and numbered from Fo. 1
to F 0. lxxx. Commune. aa to ff, all in eights. (4) Sanc-
torale, from S. Andrew to S. Wilsrid. A to H in eights
and 1 in four. There are two sizes os type used, and each
page has two columns with thirty-three lines to a column.
Pars EstivaliS. (1) Temporale. (This is os a later edition
than the rest of the volumeS.) SignatureS. aa to rr all
in eights and ss in four. (nn iij. and nn iiij. are wrongly
printed mm iij. and mm iiij.) There is but one type
used τ and in each column of this part os the book there
are 35, not 3 3, lines, This temporale resembles greatly
the edition os 1526, printed by Regnault. (2) Kalendar.
8 folios, of Sarum use, with the ‘Envoi’ of Constantinus
