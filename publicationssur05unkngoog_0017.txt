Imprint in red on verso of ‚page 478 [y. 10. b] :

Breviarium secundum morem et consuetudinem sancte ecclesie

tatis .· intemerate quoque genitricis dei virginis marie .· totiusque

In size it is a small octavo: in black letter: bound in
brown calf, and wrongly lettered 1498. Each solio is
paginated in right-hand corner in red numerals: which.
excepting the 8 solios of the Kalendar, run through the
whole book.

The signatures are from 1 to 34 in eights: and 35 in
twelveS. In this first series are included the Temporale,
Kalendar, Psalter, and Commune. The second series of
signatures begins with the Sanctorale: a to x all in eightS,
and y (y 2, y 3, y4‚ y 5, y6) in tens, On verso osy 10 is
the woodcut of S. william which concludes the volume.

The numbering at the top os each folio is very defective
between 190 and 198. This latter should be 200: and
allowing eight more for the 8 folios of the Kalendar, the
numeral 209 with which the first folio of the Psalter corn-
mences comes exactly right. So that both by signatures and
by numbering the book proclaims itsels complete, with no
hiatus: although there are many things in other Breviaries
which are not in Y. e.g. the Penitential Psalms, It is six
inches high by four broad: each solio has 2 columns, with
36 lines in each. On the title-page, in MS„ is a notice: ⁴ This
is not noted in Maittaire, therefore very rare. W. (ἓ) Ame5.'
That this is an error we have shown above, p. viii. note. There
