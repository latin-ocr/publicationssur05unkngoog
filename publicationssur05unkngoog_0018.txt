This is a copy of the whole Breviary in one volume, but
with many an ⁸ hiatus valde deflendus⁹ It has neither title
nor general imprint: and the Kalendar is gone. The first
folio (unpaged) is a 2 : solio 1 is gone. whether it were blank

· or had the title. (1) Temporale. The first series os signatures
runs from a to r, all in eights: from Advent to Easter Eve. ·

The second series goes from aa to mm, all in eights, from Easter
Eve to the Commemorations. But aftermm 8 b comes an hiatus
probably of 8 folios ε and there also should have been placed
the Kalendar. (2) Psalter and Commune. Third series os sig-
natures from A i to M 8 b from Sunday Mattins to Commune
unius virginiS. ‘ The commune wants a part of the service
‘unius virginiS, all of plurimarum virginum and unius ma-
‘ tronae: and another os unius virginis. It is deficient in the
‘ Commemoratio B. Marie Virginis, and it wants the Com-
‘ memorations of S. William, of SS. Peter and Paul, and
⁴ All Saints 3 as separate services coming with special rubric
⁴ after the commemoratio B. Marie V. and before S. Andrew.
‘ It wants likewise a series os Benedictions! (MS. note by
Rev. W. J. Blew.) (3) Sanctorale begins on ccj. (aa and bb want-
ing), and runs on to hh 6 b (hh is signed hhij.) Here occurs
the only colophon in the volume. 01 Finis prime partis hujus
breviarii scilicet temporis hyemalis de sanctiS. There then
occurs a terrible lacuna from aaj to oo 8 (112 folios): pp and
qq are there in eights and vv xx and yy: rr j to tt 8 are
wanting, and of z folios 1, 2, 7 and 8 are wanting, and all that
would complete the services of S. Katherine S. Linus and
S. Saturninus The book is ἢ inches by 32, and has 2
columns in a page and 32 lines to each column. It is bound in
dark green morocco with a silver cross let in on either board.
It is lettered ‘ Breviarium Eboracense. Pars Hyemalis! We
have ventured to assign it to the date of 1507, classing it
with the French edition printed about then sor G. Wansfort
os York.
