mus, and once impressorum memarclm.¹ Under his name we
have notices of nearly fifty works given by Maittaire, Denis‚
Panzer, Van Praet, and Hain. To this lot may be added two
more, catalogued by M. Ales in the Library os the Comte de
villafranca, and yet two more, in my own possession. He
printed works on all subjectS, save apparently the Classics:
and this between the years 1482 and 1501 : aster which date
his name disappears. He printed for others more osten than
sor himself (indeed this York Breviary was put forth at the
expense os Fridericus Egmundt and Gerardus Barrevelt) :
and at different times he had different partners associated
with him. His device is very striking; and in its varieties
is well known to book-collectors. A copy of this device,
one form os it, from a book in the library os St. Gall, is pre-
· sented with this volume to our subscribers. In the second
volume will be given a copy of the woodcut of Saint William
of York, which is on the final page in the Bodleian book.

In its time this Bodleian book has been the property of
two Yorkshiremen, men of renown: Ralph Thoresby and
Marmaduke Fothergill. Thoresby describes it in the cata-
logue of his Museum as ‘ perfect, and a great curiosity: and
gives the summary of its contentS.² After Thoresby's death ·
in 1725 it passed into the hands os Marmaduke Fothergill.
Fothergill was Vicat of the retired village os Skipwith, ten
miles from York and six from Selby. He became a
Nonjuror⁸z and was superseded in his living in 1713. He
then· retired first to Pontefract and afterwards to Massam
Street in westminster, where he died in 1731.⁴ He be-
queathed a large liturgical library, enriched with many MS.

on condition that they built a room to hold it: this they
failed to do, and thereupon his widow happily passed the
whole over to the authorities of York Cathedral, who are
