Lepus to the clei-gy os England, exactly similar to that
in the Sarum Breviary os 1524, now in the Library of
Oscott College. (3) Psalter and Commune exactly the
same as that in the Pars HyemaliS. (4) Sanctorale,
from the Annunciation to S. Saturninus, Signatures
AA to ZZ, then the abbreviations for ‘et’ ancl ‘con,'
all in eightS, and the abbreviation for ‘ us ’ in sevens.
Probably there is one folio wanting at the end which
would have contained the imprint. This Psalter, Com-
mune and Sanctorale have, as the Pars Hyemalis,
double columns with 33 lines in each column. These
two volumes are bound by Hayday, and lettered un-
fortunately Breviarium Eboraceuse. In size they are
five inches and three-eights by three and a half: and in
the P. Estivalis in the Temporale, between the Saturday
aster Pentecost and Trinity Sunday, is inserted an
enormous Pye os 94 peges·

This very valuable copy of the Breviary did not come into
my hands till the greater part os this volume was
printed. The collation of it begins at col. 677.

Eun-run.

At the request of the Editor of the York Manual (Vol. lxiii. of this series)
attention is drawn to the fact that at p. 89 of that volume, in the Exequiae De-

functorum, Psalm cxliv„ ⁸ Exdtabo te, Deus,’ has been printed instead of Palm
xxix„ ⁴ Exaltabo te, Domine.'
